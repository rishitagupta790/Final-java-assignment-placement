 abstract class-
 
 An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.
  An interface, on the other hand, is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.

Method implementation: In an abstract class, some methods can be implemented, while others are left abstract,
 meaning that they have no implementation and must be overridden by concrete subclasses. In contrast, 
 all methods in an interface are by default abstract and must be implemented by any class that implements
 the interface.
