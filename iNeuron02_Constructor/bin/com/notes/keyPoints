 # Key points about constructor

 A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
 The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. 
 It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
 At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
 It is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
 Every time an object is created using the new() keyword.

 Types of Constructors in Java
 primarily there are three types of constructors in Java 
 1) No-Argument Constructor
 2) Parameterized Constructor
 3) Default Constructor
 
 1. No-Argument Constructor in Java
A constructor that has no parameter is known as the No-argument or Zero argument constructor. 
If we donâ€™t define a constructor in a class, then the compiler creates a constructor(with no arguments) for the class. 
And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor. 

 2. Parameterized Constructor in Java
A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.

 3. Default Constructor in Java
A constructor that has no parameters is known as default the constructor.
A default constructor is invisible.
And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
It is taken out. It is being overloaded and called a parameterized constructor.
